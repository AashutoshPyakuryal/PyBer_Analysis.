# PyBer_Analysis.

## Overview
###  The purpose of this analysis was to use Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type for PyBer. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to determine how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results
### After conducting an analysis of the data, it shows that Urban cities have the highest amount of riders and driveres, while rural cities have the highest fares while having less riders and drivers, with suburban cities being in the middle. Urban and suburban cities generate the most fare towards the end of February while rural cities end up generating the most fare in April. It is interesting to note that rural cities bring in a much higher percentage of fares in relation to the amount of drivers, as shown by the two pie charts.

## Summary
### Some recommendations that I would make based on the data are
1. Expand more into suburban areas by hiring more drivers there. Our data shows that suburban areas still have a large volume of riders compared to rural areas, and bring in more average fare per ride compared to urban areas. Expansion into the suburbs has a strong chance of bringing in more profits for PyBer.
2. Offer deals that incentize ride-pool, similiar to UberPool, which may help increase the fares per ride in Urban areas since a single driver could pick up multiple riders at a time.
3. Offer free ride promotions to riders in rural areas to increase ridership. Rural areas have the largest average fare per ride and increasing the ridership could improve profits later on.
